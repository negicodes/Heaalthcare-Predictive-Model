The following code which i sused in the creation for this model requieres some crucial steps like:
# Import necessary libraries
# Load dataset (replace 'data.csv' with your dataset file)
# Perform data preprocessing
# Assuming 'X' contains features and 'y' contains the target variable
# Split data into train and test sets
# Standardize features
# Train Random Forest classifier
# Make predictions
# Evaluate model performance
# Print classification report
# Feature importance
# You can then integrate this model into decision-making processes as described earlier.
